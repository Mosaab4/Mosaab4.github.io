## Live Demo
[Live demo ](https://mosaab4.github.io/):rocket:

Forkify is the final project of Jonas Schmedtmann's course on udemy titled : ["The Complete JavaScript Course 2019: Build Real Projects!
"](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-javascript-course/) 

## Features
The whole idea of the project is searching through more than 1,000,000 food recipes :fork_and_knife: for your favorite kind of food, retrive more than 30 result for each search key.

You can display every individual result, add the ingredients to the shopping list to buy it later :moneybag:, increse the ingredients so you can serve more people.

you can :heart: any recipe you love, save it to your browser's local sotrage so you can get back to it later.

## API
I used [food2fork](https://www.food2fork.com)'s free API plan, the free plan offers only 50 request/day, so the service probably would have problems :confused: .

## Technologies
I used many technologies in this project like :
1. Vanilla JS
2. Webpack
3. Babel
